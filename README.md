## About The Project

Our team has just joined the software publisher ProSoft.
Under the responsibility of the CIO, we will be responsible for managing the “EasySave” project which consists of developing backup software.
Like any software in the ProSoft Suite, the software will fit into the pricing policy.
* Unit price: 200 € HT
* Annual maintenance contract 5/7 8-17h (updates included): 12% purchase price (tacit renewal annual contract with revaluation based on the SYNTEC index)

During this project we are responsible of the architecture of the application, the development and the management of different versions, but also the user documentation.
In order for our code to be reusable by another team, we have respected certain constraints and tools (cf <a href="#built-with">Built With</a>).
