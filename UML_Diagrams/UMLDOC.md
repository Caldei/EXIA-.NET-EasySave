## Use Case

In EasySave 1.1, there is just one new client request, it's French language support. Therefore, our Use Case Diagram did not changed a lot from the last version : wa just added a "Change Settings" part. 

## Activity 

Such as the Use Case Diagram, we just addeed the "Change Settings" part.

## Class

However, in this version, we decided to modify ou MVVM and to make evolve Logs (from txt to json). So the Class Diagram changed a bit much than the others : we moved the content of the Model Class to the ViewModel Class, we add Settings and Log classes.

## Sequence

And finally, Sequence Diagrams are almost the same as the previous version too (we just changed Model for ViewModel).
